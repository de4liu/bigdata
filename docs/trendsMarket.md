# Big Data and AI Trends Market, Spring 2025

*Draft revision: 2025-02-23*

**Time/Location: April 25, 3:00-4:30pm Humphrey**

## **Goals and Requirements** {#1.-project-goals-and-requirements}

The fields of big data, cloud computing, and AI are fast-moving and expertise in those areas are in demand. Many companies leverage scalable infrastructure to handle structured data, semi-structured, and unstructured data, and address data volume, variety, velocity, and veracity challenges using modern tools, pipelines, and platforms (especially cloud-based ones). This year's theme will encompass AI (especially Generative AI) - teams are encouraged to explore Gen AI & AI applications. 

The trend marketplace project aims for two types of goals. Your team may place emphasis on either one or both of them: 

* **Goal A. (Problem Solving with Big Data/AI)** Identify a meaningful business problem and ***real-world*** dataset that could be leveraged to address the problem. You team will implement an appealing big data/AI solution to solve the problem. 

* **Goal B. (Explore Novel Big Data/AI Technologies)** Learn and research a novel big data/AI technology. Through research about the technology and building of a prototypical use case(s) using the technology, your gain understanding of the technology and its applications and its merits/shortcomings.

### **Business Value** {#1.1-business-value-requirement}

Your project should speak to the business needs of an intended audience. The intended audience could be a specific business or a population (e.g. business analytics students, a marketing team). I expect that in your hand out that you will highlight your big data/AI technology/solution adds value for your intended audience.

### **Data** {#1.2-data-requirement}

The most effective way of practicing data skills is to work with real world data. The project will benefit you the most if you choose to work with a dataset that ***ideally* has one or a few of the following big data characteristics** that allow you to practice big data/AI skills. 

* **Volume**: for project purpose, a large data set means a data set that has a few millions records and/or a few gigabytes (this is less than what real-world big data is, but we may not have the resources to handle even bigger datasets), or  
* **Velocity**: you are dealing with streaming data, or  
* **Variety**: you are dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data such as Json, logs, text, images, documents, audio, videos, 
* **Veracity**: your are dealing with real-world data that has biases, noise, and abnormality. As a result, you are implementing a data pipeline to perform essential data cleaning, inspection, transformation, and augmentation steps before the data is good enough for use. 
    
### **Technology** {#1.3-technology-requirement}

Every team project is expected to leverage big data/AI technologies, be it technologies we cover in the course (e.g. Hive, Spark, Cloud technologies) or ones we did not cover. Technologies are interpreted broadly, which may include (but not limited to) big data, cloud computing, Gen AI, and NoSQL technologies. Projects completed following MLOps practices are valued.

Ideally, your entire data pipeline is built to scale, but I also accept projects that have some (but not all) steps that use non-scalable technologies. 

**Carlson IT** will collaborate with us to potentially provide access to some cloud computing resources on a case-by-case basis. You have give them enough lead time to make it work (more details to come).

### **Teams**

Instructor will form randomized teams of 5-6, and may balance different backgrounds in doing so. 

## **Deliverables** {#2.-milestones}

This project has two milestones: **proposal** and **final deliverables**. See course schedule for due dates of these milestones. 

### **Project Proposal** {#2.1-proposal}

The first milestone is to submit your **project proposal** to get instructor feedback. 

- **Proposal is not graded, and is only for obtaining feedback and approval.** 
- Please submit your project **proposal draft** l through the instructor designated google doc (a separate doc for each team).  
- The approved **proposal**/**abstract** will be shared in this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N0Xt_rOYABV7DEuAdMEXxPVD1Zi7b1rzIxlgxM0d4iY/edit?usp=sharing).

Your proposal should have these elements

- **Team number**
- **Members**
- **Project Title**
- The **project description** depends on your project goal:

    - Goal A - Problem Solving with Big Data/AI: 
      
        - What is the topic of your project 
        - what kinds of data you will use (how you get it, **provide links to data sources**). 
        - What kinds of analysis do you plan to do? Who is your target audience? 
        - which tools will be leveraged for major steps of data engineering and analysis (ingestion, ETL, exploration, model building, deployment etc).     

    - Goal B - Explore Novel Big Data/AI Technologies 
      
        - what kind of technology you plan to focus on, 
        - what you plan to cover in your demonstration, 
        - where resources you plan to draw upon (books, videos, PPTs, articles etc \- so that the instructor can also evaluate the feasibility and interestingness). 
        - If you proposal includes a use case, describe what kinds of analysis you plan to do, including links to possible data sources.

**The project proposal workflow is as follows**:

1. Enter a draft proposal in the designated Google doc for your team
2. Contact the instructors for feedback (with your google doc as an attachment).
    - Initially, you may present 2+ options to get an instructor opinion on which one is preferred. 
    - You may also verbally talk to the instructors and/or schedule an appointment.   
3. The instructor will give feedback, including how/whether you should proceed. 
4. If a revision is required, you should revise your proposal and repeat steps 1-3. 

Once the project starts, if your team requires assistance from the instructor, please make an appointment on a case-by-case basis. 

### **Event Day Deliverables** {#2.2-trend-marketplace}

On the day of the Trends Market, each team will have a table to showcase their work for peers, external evaluators, and professors, and prepare to give a short presentation with Q\&A. 

Prior to the day of the Trend Marketplace, the team will need to prepare the following material:

* A two-page / 1 sheet **handout** that summarizes the project, data, methodology, results/takeaways.
    - The handout should **clearly mark team Number and member names**.   
* Prepare a short (< 5 minute) **briefing** that includes:
    - A demonstration of the technology or solution, or
    - A slideshow or poster board summary

### **Post-event Final deliverable** {#2.4-final-deliverable}


* Please submit your **github** link and the **video presentation** link to the  [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N0Xt_rOYABV7DEuAdMEXxPVD1Zi7b1rzIxlgxM0d4iY/edit?usp=sharing) as well as the **Trends Market assignment** on canvas before the submission deadline.

**Github.com Repository**

A git repository is a preferred way of showcasing your skill sets (e.g. to potential employers). The git repository will host your project materials. It is also a place for a more technical audience to dig in and learn from your work.

Your **git repository** should include the following components:

* **(required)** A **README.md** markdown file that serves as a project homepage and introduction/**executive summary**. It also provides links to more project-related materials, e.g. video, flier, links to dataset, links to relevant articles/resources. The readme should mention that “*This project repository is created in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Big Data Analytics course offered by the Master of Science in Business Analytics program at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota*.”   
* **(required)** An **instruction**: provide instructions on how to use (reuse) this project’s codes (e.g. setup/installation, commands, steps, requirements etc).  
* **(required)** **Project scripts** (commands, python scripts, jupyter notebooks, SQL queries etc) that you use in the project with proper documentation/comments for ease of understanding. *Please note that the code should be free of password and credentials* (you should not commit such confidential information to the repository to begin with). 
* **(required)** The **flier** (pdf).  
* **(optional)** You may choose to provide a link to the project video in the README.md.  
* (optional) bibliography and credits: give credits to sources that you use (e.g.,  papers/articles, web pages, data source, git repository etc). This is part of the scholarly honesty requirements and allows the instructor to evaluate the amount/quality of work the team has done.   
* (optional) additional resources (e.g., pdf documents and/or links to external resources).  
* (optional) sample data (small data, but not the whole data because github is not meant for storing large quantities of data). ***Note**: big files should be submitted via Google drive*.

**Video Presentation (10 min or less)**

The goal of video is to explain the business value of your project to bring people on board with your idea. In the meantime, you need to describe the technology/methodology sufficiently for people to develop a high level understanding of your approach. Keep in mind that you should explain technical concepts in an intuitive way so that people without data science backgrounds can make sense of it.

You may leverage [**voicethread**](https://it.umn.edu/services-technologies/voicethread) for collaboratively recording a video. but feel free to use other recording tools. 

In general, each member of the team should present part of the project video. 

As you prepare your presentation, consider the following:

* **What’s the “big idea” or headline message for the project?** What value/benefits does it offer this audience? Why should they care? How will it help this audience achieve a goal or address a problem they have? What motivated your team to choose this topic?  
* **In what context(s) is your project relevant?** How is it *similar* to other approaches/tools used in that context? How is it *different* from other approaches/tools used in that context?   
* **How will you convince the audience that the value/benefits are real?** What evidence will you provide? How will you illustrate the value/benefit? Will you provide a demonstration? Use cases? Proof of concept?  
* **Which technical aspects need to be covered?** What does this audience need to know about the data, approach, processes, tools, or methodology used? You likely won’t be able to cover everything, so consider what is most interesting to your audience, as well as which details help illustrate the value/benefit. For example:  
    - Data sources, types, characteristics, etc.  
    - Descriptive analytics or statistics  
    - Screenshots, illustrations, demos, flow-charts, etc.  
* **How will you present the content effectively?** Most teams will likely use PowerPoint or other slide software. Consider how you will use visuals and demos to support your case.  
* **Concluding remarks**: How can you reinforce the big idea? What might be some future directions you want to discuss? What did you learn from the project?

Your presentation *should not* be point-by-point answers to the above questions. Rather, you should craft a coherent presentation that effectively communicates your project to the audience. 

## **Grading** {#3.-evaluation}

We use the following evaluation methods:

* (10%) **Completing your deliverables** (project video, flier, git repository, evaluation of other teams & your teammates)  
* (40%) **Peer evaluation**. Each student will evaluate at least two other team’s projects based on the team’s project video, flier, git repository, and booth visit.  
* (25%) **Instructor evaluation**. The instructor will evaluate each project based on the team’s team’s project video, flier, and git repository.  
* (25%) **External evaluation**. External evaluators’ evaluation of the project.   
* (5% bonus) **Best in show**: Each team will submit a consensus list of their picks for the top 3 projects of the entire session.

Evaluations will generally use the following criteria:

* **Business value** (20%): The project topic is meaningful/interesting for intended audience. The problem being addressed is relevant, with clear potential impact.
* **Technical Quality** (20%): The technical approach of the project is sound and appropriate. 
* **Presentation** (30%): The presentation is clear, effective, and well organized. Instructor evaluation may take into account the organization and completeness of the team's github repository. 
* **Novelty** (20%): The team introduces a technology, solution approach, or problem domain. The project demonstrates creativity and innovation. 
* **Professionalism** (10%): The team conducts themselves professionally in presentations and interactions. The video presentation adheres to professional standards.

Teammate Evaluation 

* **Member contribution**: We will collect your anonymous evaluation of your teammates. While in general every team member receives the same project credits, those who lack contribution (as reflected by teammate evaluation and comments) could receive partial to zero credit for the team project.   
* **Professionalism**: The team members will also submit anonymous evaluations of each other in terms of professionalism in the collaboration process. The instructor reserves the right to take measures to address professionalism issues including imposing a penalty on members who violate the code of professionalism.


## Sample Past Projects {#1.4-sample-projects-from-the-past}

See below for sample projects from previous years’ full-time MSBA students (please note that there are a number of stream projects because we had time to get a bit into streaming during the fall semester). You are welcome to reuse and expand on these projects (but you **should always give credits to prior work including what you’ve found on the Internet**).
