# Homework Submission Guidelines

### 1. Credit sources to avoid plagiarism

For short answers, if you use others' work as part of your answer, please properly cite your source. While it is fine to use web or other sources as a reference, you are **prohibited from to lift whole paragraphs** from the Internet. This is considered plagiarism, especially when you do not indicate the boundary of the copied content. When you quote a whole sentence or more, please add quotation marks around the copied content and indicate sources, so that we know you did not write that. 

Please refer to the following example for inline citation and bibliography styles. Please use the author-year format for inline citations. 

This phenomenon has been mentioned in several sources include a web page [^1] and a journal paper **(Yeh 1996)**. [^2]

[^1]: "Zen and the Art of the Internet." http://freenet.buffalo.edu/~popmusic/zen10.txt 

[^2]: Yeh, Michelle. "The 'Cult of Poetry' in Contemporary China." Journal  of Asian Studies  55 (1996): 51-80. 

### 2. Generative AI Policy

Generative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, DALL-E, Bard, and others, can be valuable resources for enhancing your learning experience. In this course, we also provide a SmartPal chatbot for course-specific Gen AI support. However, their use must align with the following guidelines to maintain academic integrity and ensure meaningful learning:

You are encouraged to use Gen AI for non-exam assignments, including homework. You may use it to explore ideas, brainstorm solutions, or enhance your understanding.

That said, you should use Gen AI responsibly:

- **Accuracy and Relevance**: AI outputs can be inaccurate or irrelevant. Always verify and refine the generated content to ensure it aligns with the course material and the specific question or context.
- **Understanding**: You must fully understand and be able to explain all submitted work. If asked during exams or discussions, you should demonstrate knowledge of the content without AI assistance.
- **Original Perspectives**: Incorporate your own ideas and analysis. Gen AI should support, not replace, your critical thinking and individual contribution.


### 3. Submission format

Submit all your answers in acceptable file formats (html, pdf, docx), preferably in one file. We do not accept ipynb because Canvas does not know how to render it.

On Databricks, you can **export your notebook as HTML** and submit the HTML file.

If your submission includes multiple files, attach them individually (do not zip it). 


### 4. How include an image in your submission

If you need to upload a picture, we suggest you to upload the image to a free image hosting site [https://freeimage.host/](https://freeimage.host/), and then copy the **Markdown Full linked** code into a markdown cell (a cell started with `%md`, as shown below, where the second line is coped from freeimage.host).

### 5. How to take a screenshot
Occasionally you may need to submit a screenshot. Here are some tips

**Windows** : In windows 7 or above, you may use the built-in **Snipping tool** , which allows you to select an area on screen and capture it. In Windows 10, you may use shortcut "**Win+Shift+S**" to select a screen area to save.

**Mac** : On Mac OS, Press **Command-Shift-4**, and then drag the cross-hair pointer to select the area.
